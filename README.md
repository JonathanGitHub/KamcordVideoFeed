KamcordVideoFeed
================

A simple video feed app

The following URL is a live feed of videos in the Kamcord UIâ€™s watch view: 
https://www.kamcord.com/app/v2/videos/feed/?feed_id=0. 

Basically the app fetch json data from the above link and render thumbnails on left and video titles on the right.
When a user clicks an item from the listview, it should redirect user to a videoview and display the streaming video.

I used some codes from here http://www.phonesdevelopers.com/1741623/
